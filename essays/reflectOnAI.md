## Introduction

AI, a growing mastermind, homework-solver, life-navigator, friend, whatever you may think of it as, has found its way into the lives of many students. A notably increased number of students have expressed the necessity of AI in class work. 

## Personal Experience with AI

	1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
		The Experience WODs were definitely doable without AI chatGPT.
	2. In-class Practice WODs
		I was able to do in class Practice WODs without AI chatGPT, however, there may have been one time I used ChatGPT because I couldn't remember the syntax for something.
	3. In-class WODs
		I was able to complete WODs within the allotted time, so I did not use AI.
	4. Essays
		If I ever use ChatGPT for essays, I use it to organize my thoughts and help me develop an outline of what to discuss.
	5. Final project
		For our final project, we used chatGPT to figure out how to divide up the work. We also needed AI to understand the Meteor Accounts collection.
	6. Learning a concept / tutorial
		When I need a basic overview of a concept, I go to chatGPT to give me a paragraph or two to read. An example from the above: composing an overview of Meteor Accounts collection with the necessary information for utilization.
	7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
		If it was a bug related question, I simply looked up the error and read through Stack Overflow.
	8. Asking or answering a smart-question
		I have not used the smart-question discussion board on the Discord.
	9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
		The documentation on most functions have example(s) and it was easy to understand. For Underscore, I would look up the function and read the utilization information.
	10. Explaining code
		I have not used chatGPT to explain code. 
	11. Writing code
		I also have not used chatGPT to write code. Even if chatGPT would help to write a simple code in a fraction of the time I would take to write it, I would rather go through the process of writing it all out.
	12. Documenting code
		I am honestly really particular on how I explain or comment my code. I have a certain way in which I document information about my functions.
	13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
		I have used this a couple of times to find spelling errors in my code, but more often, I use ESLint.
## Impact on Learning and Understanding

I feel that one can become to reliant on AI. Although there are usages of AI that have enhanced learning software engineering concepts, for example, 311, the algorithms course, has concepts that may be difficult to understand without proper instruction. ChatGPT can help to put together information about the concepts that may be easier to understand than a technical textbook. But for software engineering concepts, I don't know if there are benefits to using AI, since majority of AI usage in 314 was related to how to program a certain function on a website or checking for errors in the code.
I don't think AI has helped skill development or problem-solving capabilities, but AI can definitely assist comprehension of topics. Using AI to solve problems or to code programs for you can develop your reliance on AI. When there is a bug in your code, it would be very difficult to debug the code that you have not written and not practiced writing.
## Practical Applications

I have seen applications of AI in chatbots for basic tasks, like setting up appointments and scheduling. AI art is very interesting as well. Although there is the discussion whether or not AI art can be considered new art, since AI sources from the internet, I found that the art that AI does produce is definitely beautiful at times. 
I also find AI auto-filling in coding is convenient.
## Challenges and Opportunities

I have noticed that there are times where AI generated code does not adapt well to new prompts. For example, if ChatGPT is prompted to create a program that will complete a task, but then add another function onto the program that it created, AI may struggle to create a program that will successfully accomplish the first and second task. 
## Comparative Analysis

Allowing the use of AI in software engineering education allows for students to explore the limits to AI usage in coding. I don't think AI has helped engagement or knowledge retention. I believe it gives us an excuse to not practice/develop certain skills. In traditional teaching, where the student isn't encouraged to look information up online, I think students practice certain concepts more, thus are more prepared to program more difficult projects in the future.
## Future Considerations

When AI evolves to being capable of taking an idea and find solutions to the idea that has never been discussed or talked about. I think we will hit a challenge in our generation where so many students are heavily reliant on ChatGPT, thus do not know how to go about certain situations where ChatGPT does not work. 
## Conclusion

I personally think that AI does not need to be a significant part of Software Engineering course, however, AI is a powerful tool that is great for learning new concepts.
