Bootstrap is a CSS framework with visually organized designs for websites to help users/website-builders create a nice user-friendly website. We can create an interactive website simply using the Bootstrap classes as it also has JavaScript built into the library.

However, if you are not extremely familiar with the Bootstrap library of classes, Bootstrap is really hard to navigate.

Speaking from my experience, Bootstrap margins and paddings is hard to work around. I would rather use CSS. If I’m being honest, I have mixed feelings about Bootstrap. Although it is very convenient, it has been very difficult to navigate through the seemingly endless classes.

If I know what the class’s capabilities are, I will be able to easily implement them but when you start by searching for a class that has the functionalities you want for your website, it takes much longer than it would to write out your own code. 
I had countless errors in the formatting. Classes that I thought would help me ended up working against me, creating problems with the visual of the website. 
When we were working on assignments to implement Bootstrap, I would imagine this writing assignment to be paragraphs on paragraphs of rants about Bootstrap, but now that I am here, I reflect on the classes, look at Bootstrap websites vs websites with straight CSS (unless made by a high level professional), have been very noticeably different. Bootstrap websites being typically more organized.
