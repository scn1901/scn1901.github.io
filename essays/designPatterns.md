## Humans are creatures of habit. 

People say that humans are creatures of habit. We are made to follow patterns. When you feel that you can predict someone, you are most likely right. Humans have been designed to create and follow patterns of thinking, patterns of action. People utilize this fact in the game development industry or in social media platforms to promote increased usage of their app. 

However, a more interesting example of a design pattern of human behavior that we can discuss is flirting. Yes, you heard me right, flirting. Although complex and nuanced, we can map out the design patterns of flirting in humans. 
Some key aspects of flirting as a design pattern, first, is communication design. In conveying interest and attraction to a person, humans will implement body language, eye contact, compliments, and teasing in interactions with the person of interest. 
Like many design patterns, flirting utilizes repetition and consistency. Repeated signals will increase a person's attention toward the other person. 
This causes a feedback loop, another aspect of this design pattern, as successful flirting will increase interactions between the two humans as it is the way for both sides to gauge how either side feels about the other.
We then must talk bout adaptability. Flirting patterns are adaptable to a person (different styles), to fit the reciprocant, to different social and cultural contexts, and to how the flirting is received.

## Design Patterns Code (of Conduct)

While my design patterns of the above are highly classified, we can take examples from design patterns that I have observed since the beginning of the semester. 
1. Showing support when the other person is stressed by physical touch, patting the other person's shoulder (especially when it not normal for this person to want to do such things with their other friends)
2. Participating in activities in order to spend more time with the other person.
3. Going out of their way to help the other person

## Design Patterns in Code
Now for the technical design patterns in my code. I typically write comments in a standardized format, especially if it is a comment about a funciton. The format of the comments I write is as follows:
```
/*
 * Program: Project/Function Name
 * Programmer: My Name
 * Create Date: Date of Creation
 * Edit Date: Date of edits
 * parameters:
 * returns: 
 * description
 */
```

In addition, I name my variables in a specific manner. For example, variables that save user input will have the word user in the front, followed by (in camelCase) either a variable type or a word or two about what the word is supposed to represent: userInteger, userInputName, userInputInteger.
