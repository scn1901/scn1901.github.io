# Software Engineering
As our trusty, geeksforgeeks.org eloquently writes, "Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software." This course has re-enforced notable skills that are essential to programmers in the workforce. 
## I was tricked... Twice
I was misled! I felt betrayed... "314, Software Engineering I, is just Web Dev!" I wailed in despare. However, within a couple weeks, I slowly realized that that was not necessarily the case and ICS 314 was infact going to teach us the fundamentals of software engineering. Through website development, I worked on developing skills that are useful in all programming, including concepts such as coding standards, agile project management, and design patterns. 
### I don't doubt Coding Standards are useful...
Coding standards are very useful in the workforce, especially for the fact that many projects will be worked on by a team of developers. Coding standards would allow for code to be "readable" by all who work on the project which allows for collaboration not only in the present, but also in the future and errors to be easily idetified.
However, I often feel that I enjoy writing code in the way that makes sense to me. For example, camelCase has always been my go-to when creating variables, but throughout this course, underscores have been used in all variable creation. My personal coding standard is to use underscores for global variables or library variables, not for the variables you create in your code. I tend to implement this wherever I can, but I noticed that most programmers would rather use lengthy, underscored variables rather than camelCase. 
### Agile project management
First, scheduling 3 milestones for the project helped ensure that we didn't procrastinate until the deadline to complete the project. Using the project boards on GitHub Organization for our Final Project was helpful in keeping people accountable for their work but also making sure that everyone in the group was aware of what others have accomplished in the project. 
In our team, however, I do think that we needed one designated person to hunt people down and make sure they got their work done, since the deadlines we set for the tasks did not seem to phase one person in partigular. Their work did not get done throughout the latter two phases of our project. I had to ask them multiple times, but it still was not completed; I ended up having to take on his task at the very last minute. If not for this trouble, we would have done fine without a leader-like person in our team.
### Design Patterns
As we now know, after going through ICS 314 course actively using this structure, design patterns are very useful, repeatable solutions for problem to be solved in software. 
Although I complained frequently about Meteor, it has been quite useful throughout web development. The Meteor design patterns made it easy to understand the flow of page and component creation. I do believe I was able to learn faster because of the intuitive setup of the template meteor web application.
