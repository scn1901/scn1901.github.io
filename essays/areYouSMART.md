StackOverflow worthy queries
Meaningful subject headers
Applicable question
Ready to be checked code
Thought and Considerations

This is an acronym I created 5 minutes ago to assist your understanding and remembering of “SMART” questions for StackOverflow.
S for the title starts this acronym:
#### ’StackOverflow worthy queries’ 
#### ‘Meaningful subject headers’
Follows as, proper StackOverflow headers will have headers that explain the problem that you need to solve without being too wordy. Explaining the problem doesn’t necessarily mean stating the question. Many times, it will include the summarized error that the coder encountered and what type of implementation they are trying.
#### ’Applicable question’
refers to making sure your question is for concepts, meaning, the question isn’t asking to have a topic explained to them. This includes asking how to utilize a code, how to implement a code, the definition of a programming term, etc. If your question does fit into the category of conceptual, then your first step is to consult a textbook or google to understand the code you are trying to implement.
#### ’Ready to be checked code’ 
means that your code should have been checked by you previously for minor errors, such as misspellings of variables, and missing or excessive punctuations ( {}, ; , : , [], () ).
And lastly,
#### ‘Thought and Considerations’
which means the coder must put thought into a response following any answers given in response to the question. Once the answer is received and the coder has been able to complete/run the code properly, the coder must update the question, providing the fixed code and a follow-up response on the solution. The header should also be edited so that the title concludes in ‘RESOLVED’ or ‘FIXED’. And finally, considerations refer to the coders addressing the user who helped them get to the answer and the complete code. 

Okay, maybe the acronym doesn’t help to remember these key points, but now we have an idea of what ‘smart’ questions are.

## I agree….
In my opinion, these ‘smart’ questions are indeed the better questions. It makes sense why hackers would not respond to uninteresting questions that are most likely a result of little to no effort into studying the material themselves. I understand that hackers on StackOverflow and sites like it are similar to TA’s in the mind of the coder asking the question, but since the purpose of StackOverflow is not to tutor people or give tutorials, it would only make sense.

## However…
Not all coders posting on StackOverflow with purely conceptual questions do so with the intent of obtaining the answer without trying to solve the problem themselves. Sometimes, a problem with the code seems like an error with an unknown cause, when it is actually an incorrect implementation of a code, or conceptual misunderstandings. 

### Bad Question
One example of a bad question on StackOverflow was a post that asked, “How can I optimize a recursive algorithm for calculating Fibonacci numbers in C++?” At first, you may see this as a question that is straightforward and purposeful, however, this question is asking for an answer to the problem that the coder should be trying to solve themselves. Even if they had already created their own fibonacci code, when the question is asking for a direct answer to how to optimize their code, we know that this question is not a ‘Smart’ question and Hackers will be less likely to answer and/or answer in a ‘rude’ way. As StackOverflow is not tutorial site, it wouldn’t be the proper place for a question like this. And thus with the reasons stated in this paragraph, we know what to look out for when preparing a question to post.

### Good Question!
An example of a good question on StackOverflow was posted recently by a user named Steve. They titled the query, “Why is return values of dynamic programming function behaving weirdly”. While I do not particularly like the way they worded this question, namely ‘weirdly’ (a small error) I do like how they set up the problem at hand, state what they expect but what is being returned, and also including a separate method that they tried (but failed). The second, more worrisome, error was the lack of understanding of how to use the functions they were utilizing. When a concept is not understood, the coder should be learning about the concept through manuals/textbooks before utilizing StackOverflow.
