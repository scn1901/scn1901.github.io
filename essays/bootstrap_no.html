Bootstrap is a CSS framework with visually organized designs for websites to help users/website-builders create a nice user-friendly website. We can create an interactive website simply using the Bootstrap classes as it also has JavaScript built into the library.</p>

<p>However, if you are not extremely familiar with the Bootstrap library of classes, Bootstrap is really hard to navigate.</p>

<p>Speaking from my experience, Bootstrap margins and paddings is hard to work around. I would rather use CSS. If I’m being honest, I have mixed feelings about Bootstrap. Although it is very convenient, it has been very difficult to navigate through the seemingly endless classes.</p>

<p>If I know what the class’s capabilities are, I will be able to easily implement them but when you start by searching for a class that has the functionalities you want for your website, it takes much longer than it would to write out your own code. 
I had countless errors in the formatting. Classes that I thought would help me ended up working against me, creating problems with the visual of the website.

When we were working on assignments to implement Bootstrap, I would imagine this writing assignment to be paragraphs on paragraphs of rants about Bootstrap, but now that I am here, I reflect on the classes, look at Bootstrap websites vs websites with straight CSS (unless made by a high level professional), have been very noticeably different. Bootstrap websites being typically more organized.</p>
