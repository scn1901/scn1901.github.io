  We have grown to categorize people according to basic traits a person has: gender being one of the most used traits to categorize people. We observed a struggle to fit into the categories others placed on the main character portrayed in “Exiled” written by Rose Moss. The difference in cultures is also expressed in “Exiled” through the struggle of assimilating into a new culture or society in order to fit in and the dilemma many people experience when they begin to lose their own culture. 

## Exiled, Rose Moss
	Even though Hawai’i is the 50th state of the United States of America, traveling to any other state within the country seemed like crossing a border to a different country. In “Exiled”, Stephen Katela notices many differences between his hometown and America and feels excluded from his new home. 

```
The lost homeland and the new land that is home but can never feel like home (49)
```
was the way Stephen described his current loss and isolation from society due to not being able to return to his hometown and not being able to assimilate in a culture and society that does not understand his original culture, the part of him that he wants to express. While reading, I could understand Stephen through my experience living in Pullman during my first year of college, but only if I were to dramatize my situation. Being from Hawai’i, a very diverse, in the sense that Asians are a large majority of the population, I never considered myself a minority until being at WSU. In addition to being racially different from the majority of students, I was a minority in the Asian community as a fourth-generation Japanese-Okinawan Asian. I was accurately categorized as Asian, but I was a different combination of Asian culture and American culture than the transfer students or second-generation Asians at WSU. Of course, I do not mind my difference -- I have even enjoyed and embraced my individuality -- but in order to draw parallels to my own experiences and understand the character created in the short story on an emotional level, I have exaggerated my isolation within the community. 

# Conclusion
	The comments that this short story made on society through cultural differences and standards have drawn parallels to our current society despite the 26, or more year gap. Even if I never experienced living in another country whose culture is extremely different from my own, I can understand the feelings of alienization. Experiences may be different, but readers can understand the feelings of the narrators even if it is on different levels.
