Although I cannot share much of the project itself, I am able to explain the works of this project. In simple words, the project was a web application for researchers to utilize and analyse data from the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) without accessing the server itself directly. A gravitational wave detector utilizes lasers to detect gravitational waves from space, astronomical events including neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other or stars at the end of their life when they supernova. Gravitational waves are 'ripples in space-time', space-time as the fabric of the Universe that can be theoretically bent due to gravity.  This detector utilizes the displacement of the laser at a detector 3meters away from the laser's origin to observe gravitational wave data.

## Devising Plans
Professor Kazuhiro Hayama from Fukuoka University and I started this project by discussing the project he and multiple researchers had at hand: the KAGRA gravitational wave detector data was inaccessable to offsite researchers (researchers who were not working at the detector itself) unless they were to go through a long application process to obtain a profile and gain access to the server itself. We wanted to create a web application that displayed the data and analysis that researchers could use. With the server's security in mind, we decided to try utilize Django since one, another researcher had used Django in correspondence with the telescope, and two, Django utilizes Python, which many of the researchers at KAGRA are familiar with, and I would be utilizing Python to complete the data analysis of the detector data. 
I was the primary programmer of this project. My advisors, K. Hayama of Fukuoka University and Yuzurihara from KAGRA detector control center were the professionals of guidance throughout the project journey. 

## Growth in Independence
This was not only my first web application development project, but it was also my first experience in an independant project. I learned to assign myself goal points throughout the project, pace myself to not overestimate or underestimate my abilities and the amount of time I would take to complete each task. The most difficult skill that I learned and started to develop through the course of this project was how to ask for help when I needed it. As the project wasn't an easy one, especially for someone who would have to learn the basics of server to web application connection, I had to learn to reach out to people when I needed help. I learned the hard way that it was less productive to rely on only myself than to ask questions when I was stuck on a problem. I understand now that that is the process of learning.
